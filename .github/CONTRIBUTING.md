# Contributing

Contributions are **welcome**!

We accept contributions via Pull Requests on [Github](https://github.com/gajosu/whatsapp-web-rest-api)

## Pull Requests

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.
- **Create topic branches** - Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.
- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.
- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5189560/squash-my-last-x-commits-together-using-git) before submitting.
