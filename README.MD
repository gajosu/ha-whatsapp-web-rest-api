## **Installation for Docker users**

You can run this add-on on your own Docker host. You need to have Docker installed on your host.

You need define the following environment variables:

- `HA_BASE_URL`: The base url of your Home Assistant instance
- `SUPERVISOR_TOKEN`: Long lived access token of your Home Assistant instance (Instructions [here](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/en/auth_api.html#long-lived-access-token))

Docker-compose example:

```yaml
whatsapp: 
    container_name: whatsapp 
    hostname: whatsapp 
    image: ghcr.io/gajosu/whatsapp-web-rest-api:latest 
    environment: 
        - HA_BASE_URL=http://<ip>:8123 
        - SUPERVISOR_TOKEN=<long-lived-access-token>
    restart: always 
    volumes: 
        # define volume for the session file
        - ./data:/data
    ports: 
        - "3000:3000"
```

## **Api documentation**

### **How to get a User ID**

The user id is made from three parts:

- Country code (Example `34` for Spain)
- Phone number (Example `123456789`)
- And a static part: @c.us (for users) @g.us (for groups)

So, if you want to send a message to a user with number `123456789` and country code `34`, the user id will be `34123456789@c.us` (the `@c.us` part is static)

<br>

### **Send text message**

`POST /api/messages`

```json
{
    "to": "34123456789@c.us",
    "msg": "Hello world"
}
```

<br>

### **Send media message**

You can send images, audios and documents.

`POST /api/messages`

```json
{
    "to": "34123456789@c.us",
    "url": "https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/1x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png"
}
```
