Bump whatsapp-web.js from 1.19.5 to 1.20.0-alpha.0 (#146) by @gajosu

## V2.3.0 - 2023-05-19

### Breaking Changes

- The deprecated POST endpoint `/api/messages` has been removed. Please use the updated endpoint `/api/chats/:id/messages` for sending messages to a specific chat.

#### Migration Steps

To migrate from the deprecated `/api/messages` endpoint to the new `/api/chats/:id/messages` endpoint, follow these steps:

1. Update any client applications or scripts that make requests to the deprecated endpoint `/api/messages` to use the new endpoint `/api/chats/:id/messages` instead.
2. Make sure to include the appropriate chat ID in the request URL for the new endpoint (`/api/chats/:id/messages`), replacing `:id` with the actual chat ID.
3. Update any documentation or references that mention the deprecated endpoint `/api/messages` to reflect the use of the new endpoint `/api/chats/:id/messages`.

Please note that using the deprecated `/api/messages` endpoint will result in a "404 Not Found" response.

If you have any questions or need assistance with the migration process, please don't hesitate to reach out.
